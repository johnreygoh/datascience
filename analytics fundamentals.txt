1. MEAN (Average)
Purpose:
Shows the central value of a dataset.
Useful for general understanding of the data's typical value.

Excel Formula:
=AVERAGE(range)
Example: =AVERAGE(A2:A20)

2. MEDIAN
Purpose:
The middle value when data is sorted.
Less sensitive to outliers than the mean.

Excel Formula:
=MEDIAN(range)
Example: =MEDIAN(A2:A20)

3. MODE
Purpose:
The most frequently occurring value.
Useful in identifying common trends or repeated values.

Excel Formula:
=MODE.SNGL(range)
Example: =MODE.SNGL(A2:A20) (Use MODE.MULT() for multiple modes)

4. STANDARD DEVIATION
Purpose:
Measures how spread out the values are from the mean.
High std dev = data is more spread out; low std dev = data is closer to mean.

Excel Formula:
=STDEV.P(range)  ' For population
=STDEV.S(range)  ' For sample
Example: =STDEV.S(A2:A20)

5. STANDARD ERROR
Purpose:
Estimates the accuracy of the sample mean compared to the population mean.
Standard Error = Standard Deviation / √n

Excel Formula:
Assuming 20 data points in A2:A21:
=STDEV.S(A2:A21)/SQRT(COUNT(A2:A21))

6. RANGE
Purpose:
Shows the spread between the minimum and maximum values.
Simple way to understand variability.

Excel Formula:
=MAX(range) - MIN(range)
Example: =MAX(A2:A20) - MIN(A2:A20)


7. Skewness
Measures the asymmetry of the distribution of values.

Types:
Zero Skewness: Symmetric distribution.
Positive Skewness: Tail on the right.
Negative Skewness: Tail on the left.

8. Kurtosis
Measures the "tailedness" or peakedness of the distribution.

Types:
Mesokurtic (K = 3): Normal distribution.
Leptokurtic (K > 3): Heavy tails, sharp peak.
Platykurtic (K < 3): Light tails, flatter peak.

Excel Demonstration

Sample Data (Column A: "Data")
10, 12, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15, 20, 21, 30

Functions:
Skewness: =SKEW(A1:A12)
Kurtosis: =KURT(A1:A12)

Chart:
Create a histogram (Insert → Chart → Histogram).
Observe tail direction (skew) and peak shape (kurtosis).

Power BI Demonstration

Steps
Load Data: Import the same dataset into Power BI.

DAX Measures:
Mean = AVERAGE(Data[Value])
StdDev = STDEV.P(Data[Value])

Skewness = 
VAR XBar = [Mean]
VAR n = COUNT(Data[Value])
VAR SD = [StdDev]
RETURN 
DIVIDE(
   SUMX(Data, POWER((Data[Value] - XBar)/SD, 3)), n
)

Kurtosis = 
VAR XBar = [Mean]
VAR n = COUNT(Data[Value])
VAR SD = [StdDev]
RETURN 
DIVIDE(
   SUMX(Data, POWER((Data[Value] - XBar)/SD, 4)), n
)

Chart:
Add a column chart or histogram using bins.
Add mean, skewness, and kurtosis as card visuals.
Add annotation to show whether the distribution is skewed or has high/low kurtosis.

Interpretation Example
Skewness	Kurtosis	Interpretation
0		3		Normal
>0		>3		Positively skewed and peaked
<0		<3		Negatively skewed and flat
